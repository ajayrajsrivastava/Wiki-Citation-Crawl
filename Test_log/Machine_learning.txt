 machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data

Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:
 Another example is learning to play a game by playing against an opponent
 where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning
 â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,

 These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to "produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results" and uncover "hidden insights" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data

 Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

 This definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms, thus following Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" that the question "Can machines think?" be replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"

 Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation
 Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation
 Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval
 These are
 Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis

 It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory

 The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples

 Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors

It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data

Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately

The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot

This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction

They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions
